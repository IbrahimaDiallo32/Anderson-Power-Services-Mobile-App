# Directions for setting-up and running the backend environment

## Server, Docker, and WSL2

This project was built and tested to run on Windows Server, as instructed by our client's needs. IIS and whitelisting of IP's and ports need to be configured in order to allow the Database and Spring Boot application to listen for queries and, more importantly, REST API calls comming from the mobile application users.  

It is highly advised to use a server that has AT LEAST 8 gigs of RAM. 4 and lower will only cause the Docker engine to crash during startup. It is intended for Docker continers to be used to host and run the Spring Boot applicaiton, PostgreSQL Database, and pgAdmin4 client, listening to their respective ports.  

WSL 2 (Windows Subsystem for Linux) should be installed on the Windows Server in order to be used as the default distro for Docker to run on. (Reference: Image below)

## PostgreSQL and pgAdmin 4

Host PostgreSQL and pgAdmin 4 as you'd like, either via Docker containers or using the actual program. This project utilized Postgres 17. It is necessary that you have a user created on the database that has access to modifying and updating tables, which will be controlled by Spring Boot, be sure to gather information of the server IP the database is sitting on and the port (5432 being the default port being used by PostgreSQL).

## Spring Boot Appliation

The following are steps for configuring and running your Spring Boot application.  

### Requirements:

* Java 21
* JDK 21
* Maven (Compiler)
* Intelij IDEA 2024 Ultimate Edition

### Set-up:

Under the Rescources folder, add a file `secrets.properties`. This is what stores the database url, user, pass, and SHA-256 used for hashing passwords generated by users.  
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fff2dac8-bdc4-47de-ab66-0b62f398f2a3)  
The format of the file should be:  
```
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://<ip>:<port>/<database-name>
spring.datasource.username=<db-user>
spring.datasource.password=<db-user-pass>
my.app.env1=<SHA-256 key of your own choice>
```
This file is then imported into `application.properties`.

You should be all set now to compile the project with maven.

### Generate image with JAR file

After you have compiled and packaged the .JAR file, it should be present in the `target` folder. You should then be able to generate a docker image with the generated executable file.  

The following lines should be seen in the Dockerfile:  
```
FROM ubuntu:latest

RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get -y install default-jre

COPY ./target/*.jar ./app/app.jar

EXPOSE 8080

CMD ["java", "-jar", "/app/app.jar"]
```

In CMD or terminal, change directory over to the repository location of the backend folder (where you openned with intelij) and build the image.  

```
docker build -t <image> .
```

You are now able to send the image over to a private image repository of your choice in order to pull it onto your server machine, where you can then run the image as a container.









# Getting Started

This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).  

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.

## Step 3: Modifying your App

Now that you have successfully run the app, let's modify it.

1. Open `App.tsx` in your text editor of choice and edit some lines.
2. For **Android**: Press the <kbd>R</kbd> key twice or select **"Reload"** from the **Developer Menu** (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on Window and Linux) or <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>M</kbd> (on macOS)) to see your changes!

   For **iOS**: Hit <kbd>Cmd ⌘</kbd> + <kbd>R</kbd> in your iOS Simulator to reload the app and see your changes!

## Congratulations! :tada:

You've successfully run and modified your React Native App. :partying_face:
